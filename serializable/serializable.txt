static variables are not part of object state 
and hence they won’t participate in serialization process 

Declaring static variables as transient there is no impact similarly declaring final variables as transient creates no impact.


If the parent class is Serializable bydefault all the child classes also Serializable. i.e Serializable nature is inherited from parent to child.
